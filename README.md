For this project I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I'd created in a past assignment. 
In building this dashboard, I'll created an individual page for each plot and a means by which one can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also will have a landing page, a page where a user can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where the user can view the data used to build them.

The website will consist of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:

An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.


Four visualization pages, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.


A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations. 


The top of every page, will include a navigation menu that:

Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.

Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.

Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.

Is responsive such that at smaller screen sizes the navbar links are replaced by a sandwich menu. The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section.
